## Done
- Replaced banner messages in `templates/base.html` with Alpine-driven toast container (desktop top-right, mobile centered).
- Added toast manager script to seed Django messages and listen for HTMX `HX-Trigger` responses, with 3s auto-dismiss and stacking.
- Added icons and Tailwind color themes for success/error/warning/info.
- Added `core.middleware.HtmxMessageMiddleware` to convert Django messages into `HX-Trigger` payloads for HTMX requests.
- Wired middleware into `mealplanner/settings.py`.

## Notes
- Toasts normalize message tags to success/error/warning/info.
- Existing Django `messages.*` calls remain unchanged.
