This file tracks all major features and bug fixes for the project.
Each track has its own spec and plan in the tracks/ directory.

- [x] **Track: On the page for a particular shopping list, we need to remove the Clear dropdown, which currently exposes Clear checked items and Clear all items. We should replace this dropdown with a single button that just says Clear checked items. We do not want the user to be able to Clear all items at all - that's dangerous.**

- [x] **Track: The "Meal plan has been updated" message needs a button to remove it if the user does not wish to update the shopping list.**

  *Closed: 2026-01-25 | Reason: completed-externally*
  *Notes: "Done off the books."*

- [x] **Track: We need to enable the user to move an item on a shopping list to another shopping list. They should be presented with a nice UI (modal with a select field?) allowing them to select which shopping list to move it to.**
