- [ ] **Track: On the page for a particular shopping list, we need to remove the Clear dropdown, which currently exposes Clear checked items and Clear all items. We should replace this dropdown with a single button that just says Clear checked items. We do not want the user to be able to Clear all items at all - that's dangerous.**
