# Shopping List UI

- [ ] The "Meal plan has been updated" message needs a button to remove it if the
    user does not wish to update the shopping list.
- [x] Replace the "Clear" dropdown menu on the shopping list page with a button that
    just allows "Clear checked items"
    - "Clear all items" is too dangerous and we don't need it
- [ ] Every item on the shopping list needs a button to allow the user to move the
    item to another list
    - They should be given the choice which list to move to
    - The button to trigger this should be similar to the move and star icons on
        the list and should look appropriate
- [ ] The ".. checked items cleared" message on the shopping list page needs to be a
    toast so that it goes away automatically
- [ ]Sometimes when manually add an item to a shopping list and click Add Item, it
    gets added to the list but the text stays in the Item box.
    - it needs to be cleared
