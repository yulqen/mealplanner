# Product Guidelines: Meal Planner

## Visual & UX Principles
- **Minimalist Stock Tailwind:** Use standard Tailwind CSS utility classes to maintain a lightweight, custom interface. Avoid heavy component libraries to keep the design clean and focused.
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Prioritize clarity by showing essential data (e.g., total calories) upfront. Use interaction-based reveals (hover, click) for detailed nutritional breakdowns (macros, micronutrients).
- **Subtle Signaling:** Employ unobtrusive color-coded indicators (dots or thin bars) to convey health scores or goal alignment without overwhelming the minimalist aesthetic.

## Voice & Tone
- **Data-Centric & Objective:** Use neutral, descriptive language. Focus on accuracy and clarity in labels and feedback. Avoid flowery or overly conversational prose.
- **Efficiency First:** Instructions and labels should be concise, supporting a high-speed planning workflow.

## Functional Priorities
- **Automated Data Sourcing:** Minimize manual input by prioritizing integrations with UK-centric nutritional APIs or databases. Data accuracy regarding UK brands and food standards is critical.
- **Streamlined Entry:** Maintain the efficiency of the existing ingredient entry system while seamlessly layering in automated nutritional data retrieval.
